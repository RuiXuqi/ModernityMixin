# ModernityMixin

## About
ModernityMixin is a minecraft 1.12.2 forge mod, which intended to supplement the [ModernityExtra resource pack](https://github.com/RuiXuqi/ModernityExtra). By using the power of mixin, we can easily do things that a resource pack cannot do.

Most of the resources in the mod are not created by us but backported from modern versions. We will leave a copy of the original mod's license in the assets folder. The mod itself follows MIT.

The mod is using [CleanroomMC's ForgeDevEnv](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/ForgeDevEnv), which follows MIT license.
